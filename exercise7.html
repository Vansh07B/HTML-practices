    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the layout and presentation of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows web designers and developers to define the appearance of elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enables separation of content (HTML) and design, making webpages easier to maintain and update. It uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styling rules.</p>
